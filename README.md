# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of code is a set of coding and problem solving puzzles with new problems every day for the month of December. This is my first year doing it! You can find more info about it on the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) website. There's also a subreddit [r/adventofcode](https:reddit.com/r/adventofcode) where participants get hyped for the event and discuss the problems and their approaches. If you do participate, don't spoil the answers! Wait a day or so to talk about solutions so everyone can have a chance to try them. Happy coding!
